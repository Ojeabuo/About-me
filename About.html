        I spent my childhood days and my early teens living with my grandparents, they where strict but kind, they tried their best to steer us to the right direction, even though we thought there where just being too strict, but now we know better

            As I mentioned earlier, I lived with my grandparents, My Grandfather is a Reverend for The Angelican Church so we moved around a lot mostly when ever he got posted. This resulted in me going to a bunch of schools when i was young, i remember going to three different primary schools and three different secondary schools before having my <strong>SSCE</strong>

            I wrote my jamb the same year i took my SSCE that's 2012, i tried post UTME for University of Port Harcourt, i didn't get in so i bought a form for Federal Polytechnic Auchi evening studies, i got admitted to study Science Laboratory Technology (SLT). I graduated the year 2015 and did my one year IT the next year.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then took Jupeb form for the University of Benin 2016, i so wanted to have a B.sc degree and be in the medical field but it wasn't meant to be. After close to a year in the Jupep program, we wrote our final exams and i got admitted to study Biology Education in University of Benin 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my journey to study Biology Education 2018 in 200 Level and i wasn't an easy one. I went for my first ever Teaching Practice (known as TP) in my 300 Level and it wasn't easy for me because i had stage fright, I'm always scared to talk to a large group of people but i pulled through, I had my second TP in my 400 Level and also my project defense. Today I'm a graduate.
